# Epidemic spread over the flights network

The focus of this project is on the study of the spread of pandemics over the flight network. 
Pandemics are widespread occurrences of a particular disease in a population, and the spread of pandemics is a topic of significant concern to public health officials and researchers. As globalization continues to increase and travel becomes more affordable, it is increasingly important to understand the mechanisms and dynamics of disease spread in order to design effective intervention strategies. In this project, we present a study on the spread of pandemic over the flight network using network science techniques. 
We begin by introducing the dataset used in the study, which consists of a network of airports and flights routes.
Also, we provide connections to relevant literature regarding disease spreading in networks. We analyse the network on degree, centrality, and PageRank measures to identify key nodes in the network that are critical for controlling the spread of a disease. Additionally, we introduce a spreading simulator to illustrate how a disease can spread from these critical nodes. These techniques enable us to answer the following research question:


RQ: Which nodes (airports) would be critical to control the spreading of the pandemic?
